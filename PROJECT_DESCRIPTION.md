# Project Description for OpenWeatherMap API Access

## Project Title
Climate Data Analysis and Temperature Monitoring Application

## Purpose
Educational project for a university course on applied Python programming. The project focuses on analyzing historical temperature data and comparing it with current weather conditions using OpenWeatherMap API.

## Project Description
This is a Streamlit web application that:
- Analyzes historical temperature data (10 years, 15 cities) including time series analysis, moving averages, and anomaly detection
- Monitors current temperature via OpenWeatherMap API
- Compares real-time weather data with historical seasonal patterns to identify temperature anomalies
- Visualizes data using interactive plots (Plotly)

## Educational Use
This project is part of a mandatory homework assignment for students learning:
- Data analysis with pandas and numpy
- Time series analysis and statistical methods
- API integration (synchronous and asynchronous)
- Parallel processing
- Streamlit web application development

## Technical Details
- Language: Python
- Framework: Streamlit
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, plotly, requests, aiohttp
- API Usage: Current Weather Data endpoint (minimum calls needed for testing and demonstration)

## Request
Request for student access to OpenWeatherMap API to complete this educational project.
